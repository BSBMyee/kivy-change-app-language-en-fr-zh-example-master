Run the installer from the official website: https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe

Step by step:

1) View: Category
2) All: Uninstall
3) Sync
4) Search: make
5) Devel: 
Install all these. "Keep" just means it was already installed.  Double-click the "Keep" part to make it go to the latest version.

NOTE: Everything else should be "Skip" or "Uninstall".
NOTE: There should be an icon on your desktop, this is the "Cygwin64 Terminal".  It runs on bash script, the Linux script.

If you get an error message, you probably need to install "gettexxt".  The picture entitled, "gettext-Cygwin Setup - Select Packages.png" will help you with that.

【Make Command】
Note: GO TO DIRECTORY/THE FOLDER WHICH CONTAINS THE MakeFile file.  Use the "make" command.
Remember, Ctrl+V doesn't work in Cygwin; instead, you can right-click to paste. Use the following command:

cd C:/Users/username/Desktop/....../kivy-change-app--language-en-fr-zh-example-master
make


Note, if one of your folders has a space in the name, escape a space by writing it with a backslash (Notice "Box Sync"):
cd C:/Users/username/Desktop/Box\ Sync/kivy-change-app--language-en-fr-zh-example-master
